              Data security.
            </h1>
            <p>
            There are many ways to keep your data and information safe online, using both hardware and software tools. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The first thing to consider seems obvious, but is very important, physical security. This is about protecting against threats such as theft and vandalism. If your device gets stolen or lost, and you do not have possession of it anymore, it is much easier for people to get ahold of your private and personal data. This is why password protection is especially important on your devices, as this may prevent others from getting into the device if they do end up with it. To reduce this risk, make sure you have your devices on you at all times, or keep them somewhere safe and secure when you don’t. Ensure you have a tracking app downloaded on your mobile phone (such as life360) so that if you lose it, you can track where it is on another device. Other physical tracking devices (often called ‘tags’) can also be used to track your devices, and prevent theft of the device, and your personal data. For bigger companies and businesses, this physical security can extend to security guards outside the buildings, alarms, and much more complex systems.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is important to make the most of both the built-in, and the freely available software tools that many devices have. The first thing to consider is device patching. This ensures that your device is continuously updated, and has the latest security patches. These are very important, and often make the difference between a system being compromised or remaining safe. Along with regular patch updates, it is vital that information is regularly backed up. Tools like OneDrive and the Cloud mean that when data is backed up, if one device loses connection or is compromised, the data from it can still be accessed through another system. Antivirus and Anti-Malware software can also be easily installed to block any malicious connections. Usually it just scans websites or links to ensure they are safe, but there are some more advanced ones that provide even further protection.
            </p>
            <p>
            In businesses, data security is even more vital. The first thing most businesses do is provide security awareness training for their employees. This can provide them with knowledge about how security attacks can occur, how to avoid them, and what to do if they happen. This training usually has a special focus on social engineering attacks, like phishing. Phishing is an attack which tricks people into giving away sensitive information, usually through emails, messages, or phone calls. It is important to be aware of how to spot this fake communication, and to be conscious of who information is given out to. This type of education is used to minimise data breaches, where an unauthorised individual gains access to private data. Employees must also be educated about GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) laws to ensure that the company as a whole can comply with their standards. As a user, it is important to be aware that businesses can sometimes present a lack of transparency when it comes to their privacy policies. Sometimes it is not perfectly clear how your information is being used or collected.
