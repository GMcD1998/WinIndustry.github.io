              Password Security and how to protect yourself.
            </h1>
            <p>
            Passwords, we use them everyday. Whether it's the password to your smartphone, your emails, or even the password to a safe in your house, passwords are used all the time. So, how can we be sure these passwords will protect us from people stealing our information? As you have seen, when creating new accounts with companies, they will set out requirements for creating a password. This is to ensure you have the best protection against any password attacks. The requirements are usually along the lines of: make sure you include a capital letter, number, or special character, and make sure the password is over a certain length. Common practice is to make sure:
            </p>
            <ol class="passList">
              <li>Passwords include a capital letter, a lowercase letter, a number, and a special character</li>
              <li>Your password is over 8 characters in length</li>
              <li>You follow security instructions and change your password(s) if you suspect someone knows it</li>
              <li>Passwords are not written down in one space, where they could be easily accessed by anyone (i.e. notes page on your phone)</li>
            </ol>
            <div>  
              <div
              class="search-wrapper cf">
              <div class="div_container">
                <input
                  type="password"
                  id="passwordInput"
                  placeholder="Enter your password"
                />
                <i class="fas fa-eye" id="togglePasswordEye"></i>
                <button id="checkPasswordBtn" >Validate</button>
                <button id="clearPasswordBtn">
                  Clear
                </button>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="centered" id="validationMessage"></p> 
            </div>
            <p>
              While passwords remain the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-019-00429-y#Abs1" title="Encouraging users to improve password security and memorability" target="_blank">main form of authentication</a>, there are various other methods of authentication that may offer improved security. One is Multi-Factor authentication (MFA) which is a two step verification of the person logging in. This can be done with a text message sent to your phone or an email.
            </p>
            <p>Another method of authentication is by using <a href="https://oauth.net/" title="OAuth 2.0" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0</a> This allows users to log in by using credentials with an existing well-known service provider, such as Google or Apple.</p>
            <p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/" title="FIDO2" target="_blank">FIDO2</a> is an ingenious method that uses cryptography to provide secure authentication without using passwords. Instead this system uses USB devices or smartphones to perform the authentication process. They utilise a PIN number, face recognition or fingerprints to authenticate users.</p>
            <p>Extensive information about different authentication methods can be found at <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/authentication-methods-choosing-the-right-type" title="National Cyber Security Centre" target="_blank">National Cyber Security Centre</a></p>
            <p>When it comes to how secure your chosen password is, one of the most important factors is the length of the passwords. This is why the NCSC is recommending <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberaware/home#action-2" title="Take your email security to another level" target="_blank">a passphrase instead of a password</a>. So instead of trying to figure out some complicated password, we can just choose three random words: <em>CabbageHorsesParamedic</em></p>
            <p>To better understand the importance of password length, try typing in the following box! The longer the password, the more time it will take to break it!</p>
            <div>
              <div class="search-wrapper2 cf">
                <div class="div_container2">
                  <input type="password" id="passwordTTC" placeholder="Type your password here"/>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p class="centered" id="timeToCrack"></p> <!-- paragraph with the Time to Crack output message -->
            </div>
            <p>While some sources recommend regularly changing passwords <a href="https://www.keepersecurity.com/blog/2020/12/21/how-often-should-you-change-your-password-keeper-security/" title="How Often Should You Change Your Passwords?" target="_blank">every few months</a>, others indicate there is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-often-should-i-change-my-password?r=US&IR=T" title="How often you should change your passwords, according to cybersecurity experts" target="_blank">no reason to do so</a> unless you suspect your password is known by others or if there is any sign of your account being compromised.</p>
            <p>A very important security control regarding password protection is using <a href="http://www.mecs-press.org/ijcnis/ijcnis-v8-n7/v8n7-4.html" title="Password Security: An Analysis of Password Strengths and Vulnerabilities" target="_blank">different passwords for different accounts</a>. While we may think it more convenient to use the same password for everything from our personal email to social media to school related accounts, it is highly recommended that we use individual passwords for each of those accounts, as this ensures that even if one account is compromised, the others remain safe. </p>
            <p>Alternatively, we can use Password Managers. These are software programs which store usernames and passwords in one place, keeping them secure. Many service providers make use of password managers, such as: Apple, Microsoft, Google and so on.</p>
            <p>Although these techniques will keep credentials such as usernames and passwords safe from a technical point of view, the largest threat comes from malicious individuals manipulating us in giving away credentials. This can be done through sending emails, texts, DMs or even calling and impersonating staff. A study from <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/" title="2022 Data Breach Investigations Report" target="_blank">Verizon</a> one of the largest communication companies in the world, indicates that 63% of data compromised due to a social engineering attack are credentials such as usernames and passwords.</p>
