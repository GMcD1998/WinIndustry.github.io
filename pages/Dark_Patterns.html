              Dark Patterns.
            </h1>
            <p>
            A dark pattern is where a user is deceived into doing something they did not intend to do. They are designed to take advantage of the way people typically use websites, so that they don’t think twice about what they are doing. This is something that can only be prevented by user awareness. When making purchases from websites, always read over the terms and ensure you are not being coerced into performing an action you did not set out to perform.
            </p>
            <p>
            An example of this is making a simple purchase on a website. Some bigger online retailers have a feature usually named ‘subscribe and save’. This means that when you purchase something it may automatically default to this feature, and it will seem as though you are saving money when in reality, a monthly fee will be taken out of your payment account and you will be sent the product on a regular schedule, when you only really wanted to receive it on a one-time basis. This is easily avoidable by simply reading over the terms of your purchase before you make it. When using technology, it is always important to be aware and alert, and check you are doing what you actually want to do before doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
            In addition to this, it is important to consider who you give your information to when using technology. While most dark patterns are easily spottable/avoidable, some websites (usually those without secure connection) are very good at hiding them. Only give out your details (especially your bank details) to a trusted website with a HTTPS connection.
