              Safe browsing practices.
            </h1>
            <p>
            One of the main ways to protect yourself online, against cyberattacks, is to reduce the amount you share. Sharing your personal information online may seem harmless, but it can easily be used against you. People who have access to your social media can see this information and find out about things you didn’t even mean to share. For example, a photo of you on your street could easily be used to trace your home address, or on the more extreme end, the reveal of something simple like the name of a pet could let someone answer your security questions and access your accounts. The best way to protect against this is to firstly, ensure your social media accounts are set to private, and secondly, only accept friend/follow requests from people you actually know and trust. Before posting things online, stop to consider who may be viewing them, and the consequences this may have.

            Another thing to consider to keep yourself safe is the type of networks you are connecting to. It is important to be cautious about some connections, like public Wi-Fi. Some networks are not secure and have the intention of stealing information from the devices that connect to it. Look out for any warnings when connecting, and don’t ignore them! Always choose reliable connections! This also applies to things like websites, which is another way to practise safer browsing. The key is to make use of encryption, something many platforms automatically offer. An example of this in terms of websites is looking out for a simple change in their domain name. Websites that start with ‘HTTPS’ are safe to input information into, whereas websites that start with ‘HTTP’ are generally not. ‘HTTPS’ means that as information is exchanged between the user and the server, it is encrypted, and your details remain inaccessible by third-parties.
